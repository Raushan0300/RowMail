# Project Name

This project was generated using `create-next-xpres`, a CLI tool that sets up a Next.js frontend and an Express backend with optional Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```plaintext
project-name/
├── client/                 # Next.js app (frontend)
│   ├── app/                # Next.js app folder
│   ├── public/             # Public assets
│   ├── tailwind.config.js  # Tailwind CSS configuration (if selected)
│   ├── postcss.config.js   # PostCSS configuration (if selected)
│   └── ...                 # Other Next.js files and folders
├── index.js                # Express server (backend)
├── connection.js           # MongoDB connection preconfigured(backend)
├── package.json            # Root package.json with dependencies and scripts
└── node_modules/           # Node.js dependencies
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Express):

```bash
npm install
```

If you have Tailwind CSS configured in your project, the installation of `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` has already been done.

### 2. Run the Development Servers

To start the development environment use the following commands:

- **Start the development server** :

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This will start the development server, and you can access the frontend and backend at `http://localhost:3000`.

- **Start the production server** :

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  This will start the Express server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tailwind CSS (Optional)

If you chose to include Tailwind CSS during setup, your project includes pre-configured `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files. You can customize your Tailwind setup as needed.

### Customization

- **Tailwind Configuration**: Modify the `client/tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.
- **PostCSS Configuration**: Modify the `client/postcss.config.js` file to add or change PostCSS plugins.

## Scripts

The `package.json` file includes several useful scripts:

- **`npm start`**: Starts the production server.
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server using nodemon.

## API Routes

The Express server includes a basic API route in `index.js`. You can add more routes as needed:

```javascript
app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express! 'Built with create-next-xpres'');
});
```
